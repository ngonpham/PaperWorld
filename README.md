# Paper World

**Paint the road. Then leave it.**

An open-world, ink-and-watercolour driving game in a single HTML file, built with [three.js](https://threejs.org).
Drive a rally rover with a brass gramophone on the roof through an endless folded-paper world — towns, wildflower
meadows, cherry groves, ink forests, lakes and paper mountains — all stitched together by painted roads that double
as sheet music.

**New — [Cánh Giấy · Đà Nẵng](danang/):** a sister game about flying, set over Mỹ Khê beach, the Sơn Trà
peninsula, the Marble Mountains and Hội An old town. Four kinds of wings, thermals and ridge lift, ring routes
and a travel journal. See [danang/README.md](danang/README.md).

**New — [Phi Đội Giấy · Đà Nẵng](phidoi/):** a 3D paper dogfight over the same hand-built Đà Nẵng map. Fly a paper
jet, a seaplane or an Ahamove helicopter against the Black Ink Gang's ink kites, carbon-paper fighters and ink bombers,
defend the Dragon Bridge, Sơn Trà, the Marble Mountains and Hội An, and bring down the Giant Squid airship. Six
missions, survival and a practice range, guns with lead aiming, lock-on missiles, flares and Ahamove supply drops.
See [phidoi/README.md](phidoi/README.md).
